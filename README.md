# Arri-Lens-Ears
Lens ears for easily focusing the Arri 16s Lenses with one hand

Setup for 2 x M2 6mm socket head type screws - but may work with others.

If this doesn't suit your screws - feel free to export and/or modify my [design in onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/373eaaea9add8b6387b9fd8f/w/b783a86c9a65d7208e6b295e/e/820358c1ef1e07f28c485b07?renderMode=0&uiState=6778ca749745e15cfbe2c201).
